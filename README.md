This repository showcases how Weblate works.
https://weblate.org/

### How to see the result
The code is deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is accessible through https://sportstechx.github.io/weblate-demo/

### How to access the weblate dashboard
Weblate offers the possibility to be selfhosted. One of these options is using a docker image.

The Weblate dashboard was deployed using that docker image locally. In order to use Weblate properly it needs to be 
deployed somewhere accessible (which currently isn't).
